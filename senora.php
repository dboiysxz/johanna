                People ask, Where did she come from? <br>
                SEÑORA was born in Venice. She’s an idea of WOMAN. An ideal WOMAN. She improves with age.
                People ask, What is she like? <br>
                She can take many forms. Individually She has as many faces as she has moods. As many aspects as the weather. SEÑORA is an ancient ride, shifts shapes and gears. Picks up a hitchhiker and turns up the laughter. <br>
                Collectively she might be a film. She might be a magazine, she might be a concert or a very good club. She might be an exhibition. <br>
                SEÑORA! is a FORCE!
